      <p> This man, Tom Goodnough, looked guilty as he slunk along, but that was how he always looked even when he’d done nothing wrong. His facial features didn’t help: flatline of a mouth and a jaw like a badly-chiseled granite slab and eyes the color of overalls washed too many times. On this particular afternoon the wrong had yet to be committed but it was on its way.</p>

He followed his usual route between the funeral parlor and home, a journey that took him along Main Street, ducking through untended yards that crumbled down towards the pebbly banks, past the long-silent bottling plant—every second casement window smashed checkerboard-style by exacting vandals—and through the grassland where the trail grew marshy and sucked at the soles of his boots. But then he took a detour, heading towards the grand old hotel that was now used as a halfway house. As he approached it, he glanced avidly from side to side with a nervous lupine kind of hunger, licking his dry lips. Hyper-aware that this was his one and only chance.</p>
